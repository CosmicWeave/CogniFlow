# CogniFlow

**A Mobile-First, Focused Spaced Repetition Flashcard App**

CogniFlow is a powerful, offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help you learn and retain information with maximum efficiency. It uses a spaced repetition system (SRS) to schedule reviews at the optimal time, just before you're about to forget.

## Core Philosophies

This application is built with two fundamental principles in mind.

### 1. Focused on Your Learning

CogniFlow is designed to be a clean, distraction-free tool that puts you in control of your learning material.

*   **No Internal AI:** The core application contains no built-in AI for content generation or suggestions. This ensures a fast, private, and focused experience without unexpected behavior or external API calls.
*   **You Curate Your Content:** You decide what to learn. Create cards and quizzes manually for a deep, personal connection to the material.
*   **AI-Assisted Content Creation (Optional):** While the app itself has no AI, we provide guidance on how you can use external AI chat services to quickly generate quiz content in the correct format, giving you the best of both worldsâ€”powerful content creation and a focused study environment.

### 2. Mobile-First Design

CogniFlow is designed from the ground up to provide an excellent experience on your mobile device.

*   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** You can "install" CogniFlow to your phone's home screen directly from the browser. It looks and feels like a native app, with full offline capabilities.
*   **Responsive and Touch-Friendly:** The entire interface is optimized for touch screens, with large, accessible buttons and a layout that adapts perfectly to any screen size.
*   **Cross-Platform:** While it shines on mobile, CogniFlow is also a fully-featured desktop web application, providing a seamless experience wherever you choose to study.

## Key Features

*   **Proven Spaced Repetition System (SRS):** Intelligently schedules reviews to maximize long-term memory retention.
*   **Dynamic Mastery Level:** Tracks your proficiency for each card, deck, and series. The mastery score is based on your review history and a "forgetting curve" model, giving you a clear, dynamic view of what you know and what needs review.
*   **Create Flashcard & Quiz Decks:** Supports both traditional front/back flashcards and multiple-choice questions.
*   **Organize with Folders:** Group related decks into collapsible folders for a clean and organized overview.
*   **Flexible Data Management:**
    *   Import from Anki (.apkg) packages, including styles, images, and audio.
    *   **Seamless Anki Import:** On compatible platforms (Android, Desktop), you can directly open `.apkg` files with CogniFlow from your file manager.
    *   Bulk add cards/questions via JSON, with guidance for AI-powered generation.
    *   Backup and restore your entire collection with a single file.
*   **Full Offline Functionality:** Study, create cards, and manage your decks even without an internet connection.
*   **Customizable Experience:**
    *   Light and Dark themes.
    *   Toggle card flip animations and haptic feedback.
    *   Ignore cards during study sessions.
*   **Detailed Progress Tracking:** Visualize your learning progress for each deck with clear statistics and a progress bar.
